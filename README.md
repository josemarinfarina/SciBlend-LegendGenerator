# SciBlend: Legend Generator for Blender

This script is an add-on for Blender 4.2 that allows users to create customized legends and overlay them onto their renders in real-time using Blender's compositor. Thanks to the powerful real-time compositor introduced in Blender 4.2, this add-on is particularly useful for scientific visualization, where precise and customizable legends are essential.

## Requirements

Before installing Blender and the add-on, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

1. **Operating System**: 
    - Linux (any recent distribution)
  
2. **Blender**:
    - Blender 4.2 or higher

3. **Python**:
    - Python 3.11 (bundled with Blender 4.2)

4. **Disk Space**:
    - At least 1 GB of free disk space for Blender installation and dependencies.

5. **Internet Connection**:
    - Required to download Blender, `matplotlib`, and other dependencies.
    
## Features

- **Customizable Legends**: Generate gradient-based legends with various interpolation methods.
- **Real-Time Compositing**: Integrate the legends directly into your renders using Blender's compositor.
- **Easy to Use**: Configure and apply legends directly within the Blender interface.

## Installation

### 1. Install Blender 4.2

To use this add-on, you need to have Blender 4.2 installed. Follow these steps to install Blender:

1. **Download Blender 4.2**:
    - Go to the official Blender website: [Blender Download](https://www.blender.org/download/).
    - Download the Blender 4.2 version for Linux (as a `.tar.xz` file).

2. **Extract Blender**:
    - Open a terminal and navigate to your Downloads directory:
      ```bash
      cd ~/Downloads
      ```
    - Create a directory for Blender and extract the downloaded file:
      ```bash
      sudo mkdir -p /opt/blender
      sudo tar -xvf blender-4.2-linux-x64.tar.xz -C /opt/blender/
      ```
    - Change the ownership of the Blender directory:
      ```bash
      sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/blender
      ```

3. **Create a Symlink for Easy Access**:
    - Create a symbolic link to easily run Blender from the terminal:
      ```bash
      sudo ln -s /opt/blender/blender-4.2-linux-x64/blender /usr/local/bin/blender
      ```
    - Now you can run Blender simply by typing `blender` in your terminal.

### 2. Install `matplotlib`

To ensure the add-on functions correctly, you need to install `matplotlib` in Blender's Python environment:

1. **Ensure `pip` is Available**:
    - Run the following command to ensure `pip` is installed in Blenderâ€™s Python environment:
      ```bash
      /opt/blender/blender-4.2-linux-x64/4.2/python/bin/python3.11 -m ensurepip
      ```

2. **Install `matplotlib`**:
    - Install `matplotlib` using `pip` within Blender's Python environment:
      ```bash
      /opt/blender/blender-4.2-linux-x64/4.2/python/bin/python3.11 -m pip install --target=/opt/blender/blender-4.2.1-linux-x64/4.2/python/lib/python3.11/site-packages matplotlib
      ```
    - If you encounter warnings about existing directories or package conflicts, you can use the `--upgrade` option to ensure all packages are correctly installed:
      ```bash
      /opt/blender/blender-4.2-linux-x64/4.2/python/bin/python3.11 -m pip install --target=/opt/blender/blender-4.2.1-linux-x64/4.2/python/lib/python3.11/site-packages --upgrade matplotlib
      ```

### 3. Install the Add-on

1. **Package the Script**:
    - Place the provided script files into a folder named `LegendGenerator`.

2. **Install the Add-on in Blender**:
    - Open Blender and go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`.
    - Click on `Install...` and select the `LegendGenerator` folder.
    - Enable the add-on by checking the box next to `Legend Generator`.

3. **Using the Add-on**:
    - Access the add-on from the `View3D` panel under the `Legend Generator` tab.
    - Configure your legend and add it to your composition.
